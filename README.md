# Challenge

High-performance map updates

The task is to create a simple web page that displays a map and several
points (pins) on the map and updates it in the real time. It is to simulate
a tracking mechanism for several objects moving across a path.

- there should be a number of objects identified by an ID; each object
should be represented as a pin on a map and should move over time in the
random direction

- the points coordinates should be served from the backend; it should be
a simple application that generates random coordinates for each object
on the map

You have a freedom to choose the techniques, but please use React for the
frontend. Using Nest.JS for the backend would be a plus.

It doesn't need to be a production-ready application although it would be
nice to denote and comment on the loose ends and its possible solutions.
